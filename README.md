# Cab-Booking-System
This Java-based Cab Booking System allows users to register, log in, view available cabs, book rides, and view booking history. It uses OOP concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism with classes for vehicles, bookings, and user management, all in a console-based menu-driven interface.
